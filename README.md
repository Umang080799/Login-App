# Login-App
I made a Login App using Express.js,Node.js,MongoDB,HTML,CSS and Bootstrap.I built Mongoose Schemas , performed validation checks in mongoose and installed mongoose plugins. The plugins and validation checks were used to update the data acquired from the login details and added to the database.
